# Kinetic-MAP
finding kinetic parameters for microwave-assisted pyrolysis of Sargassum sp. with the particle size of 10-40 mesh
Particle size: 10-40, 40-70, 70-100, 100 mesh
there are 4 models in each particle size
the experimental data are in the different repository
one must change the code based on the particle size. The code given is from 10-40 mesh particle size
one must change the "fteb" to find the the right kinetic parameters
in sensitivity analysis, one must change the code based on the models
